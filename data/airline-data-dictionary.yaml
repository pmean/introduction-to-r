description:
  This dataset shows the number of times passengers were "bumped"
  from an airline flight. Bumping occurs when an airline overbooks
  reservations for a flight. Normally, the airline will ask for
  volunteers who will agree to take a later flight in exchange for
  cash or travel vouchers. But if no one volunteers, airlines will
  involuntarily bump passengers from the flight.
